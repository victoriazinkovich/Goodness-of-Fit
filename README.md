# Goodness-of-Fit
In this work we have tried to realise and reproduce the results of the article "A Kernel Test of Goodness of Fit" by K. Chwialkowski, et al.  The main idea of this article is to derive a statistical test, which would help to determine for given sample set whether its distribution matches some reference/target distribution.
